  "description": "Refactor entire codebase to use FreeRTOS for multi-tasking architecture. Create separate tasks for WiFi management, sensor operations, control logic, and logging. Establish task queues for inter-task communication. This provides foundation for complex system with sensors, relays, logging, and OTA updates without blocking issues.",

    "WiFiManager refactored to run on dedicated FreeRTOS task",
    "Task queues established for WiFi status communication",
    "Main loop simplified to orchestration and OTA handling",
    "No blocking operations in any task",
