  "status": "completed",
  "priority": "high",
  "description": "Device currently shows as 'esp32-26CC1C' on router DHCP instead of 'hydromatic-26CC1C'. Need to implement proper DHCP hostname setting or mDNS hostname registration so device appears with hydromatic prefix on the network.",
  "assigned_to": "claude",
  "acceptance_criteria": [
    "Device shows as 'hydromatic-*' hostname on router DHCP client list",
    "Device can be pinged by 'hydromatic-*.local' mDNS hostname",

    "test_date": "2025-11-12T10:09:17Z",
    "test_results": "Device now shows as 'hydromatic-26CC1C' on router DHCP client list. Hostname registration working correctly after setting WiFi.setHostname() VERY early in begin() before WiFi mode change and after loading config. Also added mDNS service advertisement support for future .local hostname resolution.",
