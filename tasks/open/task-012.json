  "description": "Update device firmware to send log messages via TCP socket to the host machine instead of (or in addition to) serial output. Device should: 1) Connect to TCP server on host at startup, 2) Send log events over TCP when they occur, 3) Handle reconnection if connection is lost, 4) Only log meaningful events (state changes, errors), not continuous WiFi status dumps.",
