  "title": "Implement TCP logging server for device",
  "status": "open",
  "priority": "high",
  "description": "Create a TCP server on the host machine to receive logs from the device over WiFi. This replaces serial monitoring with network-based logging. Server should listen for incoming connections from device (192.168.0.4), receive log messages, and stream them to stdout. Allows remote monitoring without serial cable.",
  "assigned_to": null,
  "acceptance_criteria": [
    "TCP server listens on specified port and accepts device connections",
    "Logs from device are received and displayed in real-time",
    "Server handles disconnects gracefully",
    "Output can be saved to file or piped for further processing"
